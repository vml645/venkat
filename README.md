# Website for my blog

A minimalistic personal blog and learning documentation website built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript.

## Want to use this code for your own site?

You are free to copy any part of this repository or even the entire thing. All I ask of you is to star this repository if you found it useful and maybe provide some credit & shoutout if you're feeling kind (but you don't have to if your vibes are not into these) :)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkatdotml/website.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
cd website
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open the website in your browser

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You may run into some issues when doing `npm install` because of the dependencies. You can always ask our AI friends to help you out. :)

If there are any errors, issues or suggestions, please feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/venkatdotml/website/issues/new).

Some ui components are from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/):

- [Breadcrumb](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/breadcrumb)

## To-Do

- [ ] Make the navbar sticky for mobile and make the navbar move its original Y position a little higher and stick to the very top when the user scrolls down
- [ ] Add a search bar
- [ ] Add a graph visualization (similar to the [Obsidian graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view))
- [ ] Add a "On this page" (like a ToC) section to the top right of the page in the PC version. It should be hidden on mobile.
